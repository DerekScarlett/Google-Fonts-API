How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON

This app allows you to ativate a click event that will acces an API that will append to the DOM a list of google fonts. Then from that list you and search through, copy/paste the font you want into another an input box and submit. This will activate anther click event that access an API that will append to the DOM the links that you would need to use in you coding projects to be able to access the font you want.

Optimizations
If I had time to go back to this I would allow the user to be able acess a database, possibly using express and mongodb, to store this fonts that they use or like so that they can go back and use it later.

Lessons Learned:
I learn the GET and POST request formats for access an api and using an ajax request.
